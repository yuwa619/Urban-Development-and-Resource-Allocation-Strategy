# Urban-Development-and-Resource-Allocation-Strategy


## Project Background Information

Every ten years, the United Kingdom conducts a census to gather population statistics for planning, policy development, and resource allocation. The most recent census was in 2021.

I have been provided with a mock census dataset from an imaginary modest town for this project. My role is to act as a member of the local government team, responsible for making decisions about unoccupied land and investments in the town. To make informed decisions, I will need to clean and analyze the mock census data provided.

### About the Mock Census

The mock census dataset contains randomly generated data using Python's Faker package. It emulates the format of the 1881 UK census, where only a few questions were asked. It includes fields such as street number, street name, first names of occupants, age, relationship to the head of the household, marital status, gender, occupation, infirmities, and religion.

My first task is to clean this dataset, as I have found missing entries and some inaccurate responses.

## My Task

The modest town in the census is situated between two larger cities connected by motorways. The town does not have a university, but students live in the town and commute to nearby cities. After cleaning the dataset, my main tasks are:

### (a) Deciding What to Build on Unoccupied Land

My choices are:

1. High-density housing (if the population is significantly expanding).
2. Low-density housing (if the population is "affluent" and there is demand for large family housing).
3. Train station (to accommodate commuters and reduce road congestion).
4. Religious building (determine demand for a second church or a different religious building).
5. Emergency medical building (minor injuries center) if there are many injuries or expected pregnancies.
6. Something else (justify my choice based on the data).

### (b) Deciding Where to Invest

I must choose from:

1. Employment and training (if there is evidence of high unemployment).
2. Old age care (if there is evidence of increasing numbers of retired people).
3. Increase spending for schooling (if there is evidence of a growing population of school-aged children).
4. General infrastructure (if the town is expanding and requires more investment in services).

To make these decisions, I will conduct the following analyses:

- I will examine the age distribution (age pyramid) of the population to determine if it is growing or shrinking.
- I will analyze unemployment trends and identify age groups more likely to be unemployed.
- I will examine religious affiliations and identify growing or shrinking religions.
- I will analyze divorce and marriage rates to impact housing considerations.
- I will examine occupancy levels (people per house) to assess housing usage.
- I will analyze the number of university students and identify other likely commuters.
- I will determine the birth rate and death rate for the town.

## My Report

I will structure my report as follows:

1. Introduction: I will provide a brief introduction to the dataset and the problems I aim to address.
2. Data Cleaning: I will document my data cleaning process, including handling missing entries and identifying inaccurate responses.
3. Analysis: I will present my analysis results, covering the age distribution, unemployment trends, religious affiliations, marriage and divorce rates, occupancy levels, university students, birth rate, and death rate.
4. Recommendations: I will provide recommendations for building on unoccupied land and making investments based on my analysis.
